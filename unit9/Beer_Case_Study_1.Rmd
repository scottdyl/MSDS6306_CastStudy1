Answering question 1 by creating a heat map:
How many breweries are there for each state?
Answer: top 5 are Colorado, California, Michigan, Oregon, Texas

```{R}
# write up of the code

# Bringing in the brewery data
brew_data <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottdyl/MSDS6306_CastStudy1/main/data/Breweries.csv')

# Counting each brewery by each state and renaming the count column to count
brewery_count = count(breweries,State)

#trimming the extra spaces off of state
brewery_count$State = str_trim(brewery_count$State)

#getting the fips for each state for my map
brewery_count$fips = fips(brewery_count$State)

#renaming the 'n' column to count 
colnames(brewery_count)[2] = 'Count'

# creating the heat map
plot_usmap(data=brewery_count, values="Count", color = "black") + scale_fill_gradient(name = "Count of Breweries", low = "white", high = "red") + labs(title="Brewery Count by State") + theme(legend.position = "top")

# getting the top 3 states by brewery for presentation
brewery_count$State[order(brewery_count$Count,decreasing = T)[1:5]]

```

Merging the two datasets from github and printing the first and last 6.

```{R}

brew_data <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottdyl/MSDS6306_CastStudy1/main/data/Breweries.csv')
beer_data <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottdyl/MSDS6306_CastStudy1/main/data/Beers.csv')

# changed the ID column name to match in each dataset and did a full join
colnames(beer_data)[5] = 'Brew_ID'
bud_data <- full_join(brew_data,beer_data,'Brew_ID')

head(bud_data,6)
tail(bud_data,6)




```

Address the missing values in each column

```{R}
# is it best to just filter out the missing data?
# how else would I fill it in? 
#unclean data count
dim(bud_data)

#summing possible missing values to see how much data we will lose
sum(is.na(bud_data$ABV))
sum(is.na(bud_data$IBU))

#filtering out the missing values and leaving the full data in new dataframe
bud_data_clean<- filter(bud_data,!is.na(bud_data$ABV)&!is.na(bud_data$IBU)&!is.na(bud_data$Style))
colnames(bud_data_clean)[2] = "Brew Name"
colnames(bud_data_clean)[5] = "Beer Name"
#clean data count
dim(bud_data_clean)



```

we would like to find the median alcohol content and IBU for each state
this will be presented in a bar chart


```{R}
# I pipe in the data and group by state then summarize by median abv giving me median abv by state
bud_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(median_ABV = median(ABV)) %>%
  #I use ggplot bar to plot the data
  ggplot(aes(State,median_ABV,fill = median_ABV)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity',width = .75,color = 'black')+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = 'white', high = 'black') +
  labs(title="Median ABV by State", x="State", y="Median ABV")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .3))


# This code does the same as the ABV but by IBU
bud_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(median_IBU = median(IBU)) %>%
  #I use ggplot bar to plot the data
  ggplot(aes(State,median_IBU,fill = median_IBU)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity',width = .75,color = 'black')+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = 'white', high = 'black') +
  labs(title="Median IBU by State", x="State", y="Median IBU")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .3))




```

we will calculate which state has highest ABV and IBU beer
```{R}


# use grep to find the max value then select the columns from the data to show which city, state, name of the beer and name of the brewery
bud_data_clean[grep(max(bud_data_clean$ABV),bud_data_clean$ABV),] %>% select(City, State, `Beer Name`, `Brew Name`, ABV, Style)
bud_data_clean[grep(max(bud_data_clean$IBU),bud_data_clean$IBU),] %>% select(City, State, `Beer Name`, `Brew Name`, IBU, Style)

#finding the industry average for ABV and IBU
bud_data_clean[grep(median(bud_data_clean$ABV),bud_data_clean$ABV),] %>% select(City, State, `Beer Name`, `Brew Name`, ABV, Style)
bud_data_clean[grep(median(bud_data_clean$IBU),bud_data_clean$IBU),] %>% select(City, State, `Beer Name`, `Brew Name`, IBU, Style)



```

Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.
for this I will be using a histogram to show the distribution

```{R}
# here I pipe the budwiser data into a ggplot using the variable ABV and create a histogram
bud_data_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(ABV)) +
  geom_histogram(fill ='black', binwidth = .0025, color = 'white') +
  labs(title="Distribution of ABV")

summary(bud_data_clean$ABV)
#summarize the data by min, max, mean, median, and standard deviation
summarise(bud_data_clean,
          max=max(ABV),
          min=min(ABV),
          mean = mean(ABV),
          median = median(ABV),
          sd=sd(ABV))


```

Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.

Answer:
  their appears to be a direct correlation between ABV and IBU. this is presented in the graph below with a strong positive relationship.

```{R}

bud_data_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(ABV, IBU)) +
  geom_jitter(width = .01) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F, color = 'red')+
  labs(title="Bitterness vs Alcohol", x="Alcohol Content by Volume", y="IBU")



```
# 8.  Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA).  You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship.  Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of course assume your audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to understand conceptually.

Answer:

```{R}

# include IPA into one category and ales into another but exclude "india pale ale" from the ale section
# test example is  "english india pale ale (IPA)"
# how to do this? filter out all the IPAs first to ensure you don't get them put into the ale section - filter out the ales and merge with IPA data

IPA_Brew <- bud_data_clean %>% filter(grepl("IPA",Style) | grepl("India Pale Ale", Style))
IPA_Brew$General_Style<-"IPA"

Ale_Brew <- bud_data_clean[grepl("Ale",bud_data_clean$Style) & !grepl("India Pale Ale",bud_data_clean$Style) & !grepl("IPA", bud_data_clean$Style),]
Ale_Brew$General_Style<-"Ale"

Beer_train<- rbind(IPA_Brew,Ale_Brew)

Beer_train %>% ggplot(aes(ABV, IBU, color = General_Style)) + geom_jitter(width=.01) + labs(title="Scatterplot Bitterness vs Alcohol of IPAs and Ales", x="Alcohol Content (ABV)", y="Bitterness (IBU)")

test = Beer_train[-train_split,]


#setting up the data frame to find the most accurate K value
accs = data.frame(accuracy = numeric(75), k = numeric(75))

# for loop that runs 75 times over upping the k value by 1 each time k=1:75
for(i in 1:75)
{
  classifications = knn(train[,c(7,8)],test[,c(7,8)],train$General_Style, prob = TRUE, k = i)

plot(accs$k,accs$accuracy, type = "l", xlab = "k", ylab = "Accurcy by Percent")
#filtering by the best accuracy value
filter(accs, accuracy == max(accs$accuracy))


#we will use K = 32 here because that gave us the best results given seed 99
